dataset\n","\n","In the previous lesson you saw how to use a CNN to make your recognition of the handwriting digits more efficient. In this lesson you'll take that to the next level, recognizing real images of Cats and Dogs in order to classify an incoming image as one or the other. In particular the handwriting recognition made your life a little easier by having all the images be the same size and shape, and they were all monochrome color. Real-world images aren't like that -- they're in different shapes, aspect ratios etc, and they're usually in color!\n","\n","So, as part of the task you need to process your data -- not least resizing it to be uniform in shape. \n","\n","You'll follow these steps:\n","\n","1.   Explore the Example Data of Cats and Dogs\n","2.   Build and Train a Neural Network to recognize the difference between the two\n","3.

For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor.
